# Learning Python

This repository serves as an objective and sequential documentation of my Python learning process.

The curriculum is organized through a structured level system and folder hierarchy to ensure a clean, systematic, and maintainable learning path. The primary goal is to master Python not just as a scripting language, but as a professional tool for rapid prototyping and high-level logic implementation.

### Motivation

This journey is initiated to leverage Python's extensive ecosystem as a complement to my existing Low-Level Systems programming skills in Rust. The aim is to create a synergy where:
* **Rust** handles performance-critical memory management and safety.
* **Python** handles rapid development, data processing, and scripting tasks.

### Use Case Focus

Beyond syntax mastery, this repository focuses on real-world scenarios relevant to backend development and the logistics sector. Future implementations will explore automation, efficient data handling, and backend logic that can support complex operational systems.

### Structure

The repository follows a topic-based directory structure:
* **Level 1:** Syntax, Memory Management, and Control Flow.
* **Level 2:** Data Structures and Algorithms.
* **Level 3:** Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns.
